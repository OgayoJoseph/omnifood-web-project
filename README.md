2.Plan the website.

-Plan and gather [website-content]: copy (text), images, videos etc.

-Content is usually [provided-by-the-client], also you can help on special occassion [small-scale-client] (simply finding images for free is easy, but if copy is needed charge extra money).

-For bigger sites, plan out the [sitemap]:what pages the sites needs, and how they are related to one another (content hierachy)

-Based on the content, pkan what [section] each page needs in order to convey the content's messages, and in which order.

-[Get-ideas-out-of-your-head]:sketch them with [pen&paper-or0design-software-figma].

-This is an [interactive-process]:experiment with different components and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution.

-You don't need to sketch everything, and [don't-make-it-perfect], At some point, you're ready to jump into HTML/CSS.

4.Design and build.

-Use decisions, content and sketches from 1,2 and 3 to [design=and-build-the-website-with-HTML-and-CSS] (design in the browser.)

-You alreafy have the [layout] and [components] that you selected in Step 3. In this step, you need to design the actual [visual-styles]
