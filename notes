[STEP-1] DEFINING THE PROJECT

Who the website is for?

-A client.

What the website is for?

-[Business-goal]: Selling monthly food subscription.

-[User-goal]: Eating well effortlessly, without spending a lot of time and money.

Target audinece.

-Busy people who like technology, are interested in a healthy diet, and have a well-paying job.

[STEP-2] PLANING THE PROJECT

-Plan an dgather website content [content-file].

-Plan out the sitemap (This is a [one-page-marketing-website] {also called landing page}, so no site map.)

-Define website personality.

Based on the tech-centered target audience, as well as the actual product being sold, we will use the [startup/upbeat] personality.
We might add some elements of the [calm/peaceful] personality, sonce the product is all about consumer well-being as well.

-Planing the page sections (check content.md)

RESPONSIVE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

What is responsive desing:

-Desing technique to make a webpage adjust its layout and visual style to [any-possible-screen-size] (window or viewport size)

-In practise, this mean that responsive design makes websites usable on all devices, such as [desktop-computers,tablets,-and-mobile-phones.]

-Its a set of practices, [not-a-separate-technology], just CSS.

Responsive Design Ingedients:

1.Fluid Layouts:

-To allow webpages to adapt to the [current-viewport] width (pr even height)

-Use % (or vh / vw) units intead of px for elements that [should-adapt-to-viewport(usually-layout)]

-Use max-width instead of width.

2.Responsive Units:

-Use rem units instead of px for most lengths.

-To make it easy to [scale-the-entire-layout-down-or-up] automatically.

-[Helpful-trick]:setting 1rem to 10px for easy calculations

3.Flexible Images:

-By default, images [don't-scale-automatically] as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that.

-Always use % for images dimensions, together with the max-width property.

4.Media Queries:

-Bring Responsive sites to life!

-To change CSS style on [certain-viewport-widths] (called breakpoints)

NB=Will be learnt on the next section [section-8]

DESKTOP-FIRST VS. MOBILE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT.

Desktop first:

-Start writing CSS for the desktop :[large-screen]

-Then, medis queries [shrink-design] to smaller screens.

NB=Project will focus on Desktop-first approach.

Mobile-First:

-Start writing CSS for mobile devices: [small-screen]

-Then, media queries [expand-design] to large screen.

-Forces us to reduce website and apps to the [absolute-essentials].

rem [root-element-font-size]

By changing the font-size the entire layout changes as well.

therefore use 62.5% derived from the following calculation [10px/16px=0.625=62.5%]

This is the % of User's browser font-size setting

In-order to add a border inside an elements we use [insert] in a box-shadow property this will ensure that the entire element doestn't move with the change of the element.
